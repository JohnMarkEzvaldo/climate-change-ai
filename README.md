# Climate Change AI: Threat Analysis & Mitigation

This project harnesses the power of AI to predict hyper-local climate change impacts, analyze threats to humanity and the environment, and generate actionable mitigation strategies. By combining advanced machine learning models with cutting-edge data sources, our goal is to empower communities and decision-makers to proactively address the climate crisis.

## Key Features

- **Hyper-Local Prediction:** Leverages satellite imagery, weather data, and socio-economic factors to forecast localized climate change effects at a granular level.
- **AI-Powered Threat Analysis:** Analyzes predicted impacts to pinpoint specific threats to human well-being, infrastructure, and ecosystems, prioritizing them based on severity and likelihood.
- **Mitigation Strategy Generation:** Provides tailored recommendations for mitigating identified threats, encompassing engineering solutions, policy changes, and community-based actions.
- **Open-Source and Collaborative:** Encourages global collaboration by making code, models, and datasets freely accessible.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers an intuitive interface for easy interaction with the AI system, making it accessible to a wide range of stakeholders.

## Project Structure

- `/data`: Stores raw and preprocessed satellite imagery, weather data, and socio-economic data.
